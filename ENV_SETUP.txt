# Environment Variables Setup

## Required Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file for local development:

```bash
# HubSpot Integration
HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_private_app_token_here

# Webflow (if using CMS features)
WEBFLOW_API_HOST=https://api.webflow.com
WEBFLOW_SITE_API_TOKEN=your_webflow_site_token_here
WEBFLOW_CMS_SITE_API_TOKEN=your_webflow_cms_token_here
```

## How to Get Your HubSpot Token

1. Log into your HubSpot account
2. Go to Settings → Integrations → Private Apps
3. Click "Create a private app" (or use an existing one)
4. Give it a name like "AI Readiness Assessment"
5. Under "Scopes", grant:
   - `crm.objects.contacts.read`
   - `crm.objects.contacts.write`
   - `crm.objects.companies.read`
   - `crm.objects.companies.write`
6. Click "Create app"
7. Copy the access token (starts with `pat-na1-`)
8. Add it to your `.env` file

## Production Deployment (Cloudflare Workers)

For production, add environment variables in the Cloudflare dashboard:

1. Go to Cloudflare dashboard
2. Navigate to Workers & Pages → Your App
3. Click Settings → Environment Variables
4. Add the same variables:
   - `HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN`
   - Other environment variables as needed

## Security Best Practices

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**:
- Never commit `.env` file to version control
- Never hardcode tokens in code or documentation
- Rotate tokens every 90 days
- Use separate tokens for dev/staging/production if possible
- Monitor token usage regularly

## Verification

To verify your token is working:

```bash
# Run the test script
node test-hubspot.js
```

If you see "✅ HubSpot connection successful!" your token is configured correctly.
